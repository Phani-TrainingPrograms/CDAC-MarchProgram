#include<stdio.h>
//Structs are user defined data types that can group several related data into one real time representable unit. Each variable inside the struct is called as Field or member of the struct. 
//structs can have only variables in it, however, other programming languages like C++ can allow structs to have functions also. 
struct Employee {
	int empId;
	char strName[50];
	char strAddress[200];
};

int main() {
	//U refer the struct by creating a variable of it. 
	Employee emp;
	printf("Enter the name, address and id of the Employee");
	scanf("%s %s %d", emp.strName, emp.strAddress, &emp.empId);
	printf("The info provided is: \n");
	printf("Name: %s\nAddress: %s\nId :%d ", emp.strName, emp.strAddress, emp.empId);
	return 0;
}
//PS: Newer compilers expect to initialize the struct variables by using {}
